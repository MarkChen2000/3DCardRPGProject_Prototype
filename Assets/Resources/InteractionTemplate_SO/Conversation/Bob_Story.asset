  - ugh...you've found me.
  - I...I'm about to die, so listen careful.
  - I made a mistake. Those monsters...they, they aren't just monsters.
  - Eveytime I kill one, I...I can hear them whispering in my ears. Even now, the
    ghosts are haunting me.
  - I have no choice...but, but to end myself.
  - They are not just monsters, they...they are...they...ugh...
