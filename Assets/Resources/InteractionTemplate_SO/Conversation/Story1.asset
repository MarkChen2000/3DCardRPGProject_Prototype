  StringTextList:
  - Welcome, young man, to the village of no body, but I'm afraid we cannot offer
    you too much.
  - Yes, viilage of no body. It's been too long that name has no meaning here. Even
    old man like me cannot recall the name of this village.
  - We once belong to a great kingdom, but the invasion of those monsters took honor
    and glory away.
  - You are not the only one who think he can save the world. I'm not discourage
    you, but many have tried and died.
  - If you demand to do so, I will say no more. But be careful, this is the land
    of curse and despair.
