  - 'Hello there! Haven''t seen a new face for a while. '
  - 'Have some rest whlie you can! Those monsters are tough to deal with. '
  - Tell ya, I killed two of those blue kind yesterday with my axe. If you want,
    I can teach you some skill.
  - 'Oh! you wanna save the world? Ha! That''s the funniest joke I''ve heard in my
    life. '
  - Bob, the crazy guy, he dreamed about something and start yelling to other that
    he can save the world. Guess what? He grabbed a rust sword, ran out, and never
    came back.
  - I'm telling ya, find a place far away from those monsters and live the rest of
    your life. It's much easier!
  - Anyway! Enjoy your stay in the village!
