This is a Unity game project called Card Master. It's my first project worked by group in 2022.
The game was made for a university class project, but eventually be nominee by a game competition.

This is a game that include trading card, role playing and rouge concepts.
Player have to use currently possess cards (include equapment and spell cards) and build their own card deck in village. 
After the preparation, go into the battle level to kill monster, earn money and gain experience point to improve level.
Once you be defeated in combat, you will be respawned in village and reset all the prograss of battle level, 
In other words, player have to finish the game in rouge system, but player can keep their level, cards and money.
After battle, use earned money to buy card to adjust your card deck and equapments, to increase the chance that defeat the final boss in next round.

Although it is a group project, but I leaded the game design and game system, 
and also done the most of the works about programming (including player behaviour, level system, inventory system and combat system, card system), UI and scene buliding.

Development of the project was be terminated.
